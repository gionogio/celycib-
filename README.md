## Max project used for [ECB~ X SPLIT #3](https://fb.me/e/ItgOeekc)

This is the Max(/msp) project I developed for a live performance for bicycle and live electronics.

The performance occurred on the 18th of June 2021 at [SPLIT Bologna](https://www.facebook.com/SpazioPerLiberareIlTempo) for [a series of events](https://www.facebook.com/search/events/?q=ECB~%20X%20SPLIT&sde=AbqgRuIjseVY9v6OIg4ObaOAQ_Dk_nZy75ZrT7UBwGpxxZ-SUocyq0-c4EJ7qat3M5JNKdDdSRpSlVoaqrVL_oAu) organized by [Elettronica Collettiva Bologna~](https://www.facebook.com/elettronicacollettivabologna/).

The project is intended to be used with some microphones input from a bicycle.

I used a variety of different tools, like externals from [FluCoMa](https://github.com/flucoma) package or sogs~ from [IRCAM's sound box](https://forum.ircam.fr/projects/detail/max-sound-box/), as well as some {not-well-written} abstractions I made.

A special thanks to [Rodrigo Constanzo](https://rodrigoconstanzo.com/) for talking about this and the externals he shares with the world!

I am not a good or smart developer.
